	<h2> Mapping Mars Northern Polar Spiral Trough Migration paths </h2>

	<img src="Screen Shot 2020-12-11 at 5.11.43 PM.png" alt="3D migration path mapped in Seisware" width="200" height="200" style="border:5px solid black" style="float:left">

  <p> Mars' spiral troughs have associated migration paths observed in the subsurface using SHallow RADar (SHARAD) aboard the Mars Reconnaisance Orbiter (MRO). Mapping these migration paths is the first step in using them to understand the variation in Mars' climate throug polar volatile mass balance. 
 The migration of these troughs is controlled by the mass balance of volatiles on Mars, and can provide insight into the variation of Marsâ€™ climate in the late Amazonian. 
 Within the NPLD, where the layers are normally sub-horizontal and continuous layers, the upper 500 meters is dominated by stratigraphic discontinuities. These have been shown to be bounding surfaces, where ice has been deposited over the eroded equatorial-facing slope of a trough [2]. 
The bounding surfaces have been associated with currently revealed troughs as migration paths, which have generally migrated northward and upward [3, 4].  
The migration of these troughs has been shown to depend on three independent processes, transfer of ice by wind laterally, insolation-induced sublimation, and atmospheric deposition of ices [5]. The slope of these migration paths in the subsurface can be used to determine the rate of these processes.

  <h2> Exploring the variability of the 3 micron hydration feature across the southern hemisphere of the Moon </h2>
  <p> The 3 micron hydration feature was found in (Sunshine et al. 2009, Pieters et al. 2009, ? et al. 2009). Using spectroscopy compiled over the course of two weeks during the Deep Impact Mission Lunar flybys, this work reveals the 3 micron hydration feature as it varies spatially across the southern hemisphere and temporally for regions observed more than once.
