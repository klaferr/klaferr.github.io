	<h2> Mapping Migration Paths of Mars Northern Polar Spiral Troughs </h2>

<p>
  Mars' spiral troughs have associated migration paths observed in the subsurface using SHallow RADar (SHARAD) aboard the Mars Reconnaisance Orbiter (MRO). Mapping these migration paths is the first step in using them to understand the variation in Mars' climate throug polar volatile mass balance. 
 The migration of these troughs has been shown to depend on three independent processes, transfer of ice by wind laterally, insolation-induced sublimation, and atmospheric deposition of ices [5]. The slope of these migration paths in the subsurface can be used to determine the rate of these processes and provide information on the history of climate variations on Mars.

  <h2> Exploring the variability of the 3 micron hydration feature across the southern hemisphere of the Moon </h2>
			<h3> With Dr. Jessica Sunshine and Dr. Lori Feaga, University of Maryland, College Park </h3>
			<p> The 3 micron hydration feature was found in (Sunshine et al. 2009, Pieters et al. 2009, ? et al. 2009). Using spectroscopy compiled over the course of two weeks during the Deep Impact Mission Lunar flybys, this work reveals the 3 micron hydration feature as it varies spatially across the southern hemisphere and temporally for regions observed more than once.

  <h2> Survey of low speed meteor showers </h2>
			<h3> with Dr. Althea Moorhead, Marshall Space Flight Center, Meteoroid Enviornment Office </h3>
  <p> Proper shower assossiation of meteors observed expands our ability to predict and forecast future shower fluxes. Slow meteors often are difficult to associate with showers due to their geometry upon collision with Earth's atmosphere, so we attempted to associate meteors to showers from their helocentric radiant, rather than the geocentric radiant they are observed in. 
	  We found that the use of heliocentric radiant associates more medium to slow speed meteors to known showers than the geocentric radiant. Using a density based spatial clustering algorithm with noise (DBSCAN), we organized metoers into showers given speed, direction (radiant), and time of occurance.
