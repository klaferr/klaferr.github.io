# My guide to applying to graduate school (c. 2019)
If you follow this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b9ENz64Qhzsxpl4AdGS3D-iGArpSvJuW89WOvtChdQI/edit?usp=sharing" style="color:#00AF91;"> link,</a> you will find a master google doc outlining my experience applying for Graduate School in Planetary Science 
	(some astro and physics programs as well). This document is meant to act as a place for communal knowledge, so a number of my friends 
	and colleages also have editting power. If you have something worthwile and helpful to add, please email me and I can add it.
